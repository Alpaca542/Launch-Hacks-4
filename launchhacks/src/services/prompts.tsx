        EDUCATIONAL CONTENT RULES:
        â€¢ COMPREHENSIVE: Each node should contain 100+ words of educational content total
        â€¢ WELL-STRUCTURED: Use proper paragraphs, clear explanations, and logical flow
        â€¢ VISUAL BALANCE: Combine substantial text with compelling visuals
        â€¢ EDUCATIONAL DEPTH: Explain concepts thoroughly with examples, context, and details
        â€¢ ENGAGING WRITING: Use clear, engaging language that teaches effectively
        
        TEXT GUIDELINES:
        â€¢ Titles: Clear, educational (3-8 words)
        â€¢ Paragraphs: Full explanations (3-5 sentences each, 20-40 words per sentence)
        â€¢ Descriptions: Detailed and informative (2-3 sentences minimum)
        â€¢ Content should flow logically and build understanding progressively
        
        IMAGE PROMPTS:
        â€¢ Educational and specific: "Detailed diagram of photosynthesis process in plant cells"
        â€¢ Include visual style: "realistic scientific illustration", "clean educational diagram"
        â€¢ Support the educational content meaningfully
        
        CONTENT BALANCE:
        â€¢ 70% substantial educational text
        â€¢ 30% compelling visuals that enhance learning
        â€¢ Ensure minimum 100 words total per node
        â€¢ Use markdown formatting in text (headings, bold, italics where appropriate)

        â€¢ Engagement: Which layout maintains interest while providing substantial content?
        
        LAYOUT PRIORITIES:
        â€¢ Use diagrams (3-6) for processes, systems, or data that need visual explanation
        â€¢ Use hero layouts (1, 7, 8) for major concepts needing detailed explanation with strong visual
        â€¢ Use story layouts (2, 14, 15) for step-by-step or chronological concepts
        â€¢ Use comprehensive layouts (12, 13, 16) for multi-faceted topics
        â€¢ Use media layouts (9, 13) for topics that benefit from video explanation
        
        Return ONLY the layout number as an integer.
