//        REMEMBER: THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT ðŸš¨: Focus strictly on the main topic. The provided context should be used only to clarify the topic or provide concrete examples â€” not as the focus of the explanation. If the context is irrelevant or distracting, ignore it entirely

    Return ONLY a valid array. Do not include markdown formatting, code blocks, or any text before or after the array.
        
        EDUCATIONAL CONTENT RULES:
        â€¢ COMPREHENSIVE: Each node should contain 100+ words of educational content total
        â€¢ WELL-STRUCTURED: Use proper paragraphs, clear explanations, and logical flow
        â€¢ VISUAL BALANCE: Combine substantial text with compelling visuals
        â€¢ EDUCATIONAL DEPTH: Explain concepts thoroughly with examples, context, and details
        â€¢ ENGAGING WRITING: Use clear, engaging language that teaches effectively
        
        TEXT GUIDELINES:
        â€¢ Titles: Clear, educational (3-8 words)
        â€¢ Paragraphs: Full explanations (3-5 sentences each, 20-40 words per sentence)
        â€¢ Descriptions: Detailed and informative (2-3 sentences minimum)
        â€¢ Content should flow logically and build understanding progressively
        â€¢ Markdown should be used for formatting

        IMAGE PROMPTS:
        â€¢ Educational and specific: "Detailed diagram of photosynthesis process in plant cells"
        â€¢ Include visual style: "realistic scientific illustration", "clean educational diagram"
        â€¢ Support the educational content meaningfully
        
        CONTENT BALANCE:
        â€¢ 60% substantial educational text
        â€¢ 40% compelling visuals that enhance learning
        â€¢ Ensure minimum 100 words total per node
        â€¢ Use markdown formatting in text (headings, bold, italics where appropriate)
        
        OUTPUT FORMAT:
        Return ONLY a valid array based on the SCHEMA. Follow the exact structure.
        NO markdown code blocks, NO extra text.
        RETURN AN ARRAY [] - NOT AN OBJECT!

        CRITICAL: Avoid layout 14 unless absolutely necessary. Use diverse layouts for better user experience.
        
        SELECTION CRITERIA:
        â€¢ Content Type Match: Which layout best fits the specific content structure?
        â€¢ Visual Balance: Optimal text-to-visual ratio for the topic
        â€¢ Learning Effectiveness: Best presentation for comprehension
        â€¢ Layout Variety: Strongly prefer different layouts (avoid repeating same layout)
        
        PRIORITY LAYOUT SELECTION GUIDE:
        â€¢ **Technical/Programming topics**: Use layouts 17, 18 (code tutorials, API docs), 1, 8
        â€¢ **Process/systems**: Use diagram layouts 3, 4, 5, 6
        â€¢ **Comprehensive explanations**: Use hero layouts 1, 7, 12
        â€¢ **Step-by-step content**: Use layouts 2, 15 (timeline), 17 (code tutorial)
        â€¢ **Multi-aspect topics**: Use layouts 12, 13, 16
        â€¢ **Media-heavy content**: Use layouts 9, 13
        â€¢ **Quick concepts**: Use layouts 1, 6, 8
        â€¢ **Historical/chronological**: Use layout 15
        â€¢ **Comparison content**: Use layouts 8, 16, 14
        
        DIVERSIFICATION RULES:
        - Prioritize new code layouts (17, 18) for technical content
        - Rotate between different layout families
        - Match complexity of layout to complexity of content
        - Consider visual appeal and educational effectiveness
        
        Return ONLY the layout number as an integer (1-18).
        
        LAYOUT TYPES:
        ${JSON.stringify(LAYOUT_TYPES)}`;
