        RULES
        â€¢ Each object = exactly one tag from SCHEMA; no new tags.
        â€¢ Include:
        â€¢ You should educate the user about the concept and then ask the quiz about the material you taught.
        â€¢ Use tags to make the reading experience diverse and engaging
        â€¢ If you have a long text, break it into multiple textblocks.
        â€¢ Only include tags that genuinely help explain the concept. Don't add tags unnecessarily or just to fill space. Code snippets should BE USED IF AND ONLY IF THE CONCEPT IS TECHNICAL
        â€¢ Tone: encouraging, professional
        â€¢ You need to have textblocks or lists separating each visual tag, e.g. img, vid, gif, codeblock, diagram, mindmap, table.
        â€¢ Make sure to put the concept over the context, not focusing on the context but rather on what actually needs to be explained.

        OUTPUT
        VALID JSON array only â€” no comments, or extra text. All the braces must be properly closed.`;
